# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Obtain a token from the /login endpoint and include it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.
